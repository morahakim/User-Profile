This is my submission for the iOS Developer test at MyFive.

I created this project using Swift UI with Clean Architecture. I used VIPER as the design pattern, along with Combine and Alamofire for API fetching and reactive programming. Additionally, I included unit testing for the presenter and interactor to meet the testing requirements.
